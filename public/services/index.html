          <p><strong>Tai Chi:</strong> Tai chi is an ancient Chinese tradition that, today, is practiced as a graceful form of exercise. It involves a series of movements performed in a slow, focused manner and accompanied by deep breathing. Often described as meditation in motion, tai chi promotes serenity through gentle, flowing movements.</p>
          <p><strong>Kundalini Yoga:</strong> Kundalini Yoga uses breath, movement and focus to energize the body while supporting strength and balance of the immune and glandular systems. Dynamic classes promote emotional well-being, mental clarity and stress relief. Appropriate for all abilities. This will be the most dynamic of all three mindful movement offerings.</p>
          <h3>Meditation</h3>
          <p>Swift Fit’s Meditation offerings are appropriate for all levels.

            <li>Location: Hotel/conference venue or a green space/terrace if weather permits</li>
            <li>Duration: 15/30/60 min</li>
            <li>Equipment: None</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Meditation Class:</strong> This class is designed to bring participants through a particular meditation. Meditations will be designed based off of the client’s goals. Unless otherwise specified by the client, meditation classes will be guided meditations where the students are guided by the teachers voice, set to soothing background music.</p>
          <p><strong>Full Meditation Class:</strong> Meditation + Self-Reflection: Just like the meditation class, but with an added bonus at the end! Once the meditation is complete, students will be given the space to dive into self-reflection through guided journaling. Journaling combined with meditation is proven to open up creativity and promote deep clarity. 
          <em>*Due to the nature of this class, it can only be offered as a 60 minute option.</em></p>
          <p><strong>Relaxing Sound Bath:</strong> This is a sound meditation. Students will be invited to sit in a meditative posture or to lay down while listening to the soothing sounds of a variety of sound healing tools: like crystal singing bowls, gongs, and chimes. Students will typically be guided in a light breath- work exercise to prepare the body and mind at the beginning of class and then will be guided into deep relaxation.  Benefits of a sound bath are: Reduced stress and anxiety, decreased blood pressure, quiets mental chatter, increased focus, and promotes increased health.</p>
          <p><strong>Breathwork / Pranayama:</strong> The breath is a fundamental tool when it comes to mindfulness. Pranayama is defined as an ancient technique focused on the regulation of the breath through certain exercises. The average rate of breathing for most people is about sixteen times per minute. When the rate of breathing increases, or if it becomes rapid and irregular, the mind also becomes disturbed and erratic. This class will give students practical breathing techniques to apply in daily life. Students will learn and experience how to manipulate the breath into different patterns to affect their mental state in a variety of positive ways.</p>

          <p><strong>Reiki:</strong> Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is administered by "laying on hands" and is based on the idea that an unseen "life force energy" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. If one's "life force energy" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress, and if it is high, we are more capable of being happy and healthy.</p>
          <p>A treatment feels like a wonderful glowing radiance that flows through and around you. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that include relaxation and feelings of peace, security and wellbeing. Many have reported miraculous results.</p>
          <p>Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. It has been effective in helping virtually every known illness and malady and always creates a beneficial effect. It also works in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery. Reiki Sessions will be set to music.</p>
          <p><strong>Light Language:</strong> Light Language is multidimensional language that is understood by all on a soul level. It is channeled Dynamic Frequency Encodings of Sound and Light. It adjusts to the resonance of each person’s vibrational needs in the moment; initiating clearing, balancing, activation, and alignment with a new vibration of Wellbeing</p>
          <p>In these sessions, students will listen to the practitioner speak light language while playing crystal singing bowls. Some classes may be set to music.</p>

The effects of ecstatic dance begin with ecstasy itself, which may be experienced in differing degrees. Dancers are described as feeling connected to others, and to their own emotions. The dance serves as a form of meditation, helping people to cope with stress and to attain serenity.</p>

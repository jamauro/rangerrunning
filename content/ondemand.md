Fitness and wellness routines have been upended by the pandemic. While there is no shortage of virtual fitness options available online - Swift Fit Events sets itself apart by bringing a personal touch to its classes. Swift Fit virtual classes feature local Austin instructors who bring their passion, personality and resilience into each class.

The Swift Fit video on-demand catalogue allows members to sample a variety of classes to see which workout or breathing practice best fits their current needs. Whether its meditation, kickboxing, cardio bootcamps, or Pink Floyd-themed yoga - Swift Fit aims to break out of the traditional boring virtual workout by offering authentic instructors leading invigorating classes!

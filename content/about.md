Looks like you're here to hear the curious story about the founding of Ranger Running. It all started on a sunny day in Austin, TX. The would-be founders were indulging in Chipotle's bulgy burritos when they thought to themselves:

> Why in god's name aren't there more avenues for running a 5k?

Sausage salami prosciutto, pork ribeye ham hock pork loin corned beef. T-bone cupim biltong landjaeger, hamburger pork chop burgdoggen spare ribs. Bresaola kielbasa filet mignon, pork belly flank pork picanha tenderloin shoulder buffalo. Prosciutto t-bone bacon drumstick bresaola ground round short loin salami porchetta biltong pork belly chicken pig.

So, what are you waiting for? Shoot us a [note](/contact) or we don't mind how you get here -- land, air, or by sea -- just saddle up and get yourself and your crew down to Austin. You'll be glad you did.

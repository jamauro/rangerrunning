Running is a unifier, whether you’re doing it alone or with 50,000 other people. The shared camaraderie surpasses language and cultural barriers — any person at any level of fitness can share in the bond of being a ‘runner’. Ranger Running exists for the single purpose of bringing fellow runners together for unique events, while providing quality amenities, comprehensive safety, and logistical precision.  Whether the running event is for a charity, conference, festival, or corporate function, our goal is to customize and create a final product that matches your vision. We handle the details so you’re not up at night stressing.

Ranger Running sprang from three friends’ love of running. Each co-founder came from a different background - one worked in tech, one was an Army Ranger, and the third worked at a running shoe company. They saw that by combining their different skillsets, they could improve upon the planning, organization, and execution of races and running events.

> Unique events with quality amenities, comprehensive safety, and logistical precision

Ranger Running separates itself from traditional event companies by offering technology-enhanced amenities, implementing military-style logistics, and leveraging a wealth of experience from previous race planning and production. No matter how big your event or budget, we guarantee amazing customer service that will ensure everyone — from the runners to the sponsors — goes home happy.

So, what are you waiting for? Shoot us a [note](/contact). We don't mind how you get here — by land, air, or sea — just saddle up and get down to Austin. You'll be glad you did.

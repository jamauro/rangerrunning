In the era of Covid-19, how do you foster a sense of community for your employees? As the attention of the human race shifts toward health and wellness, what can you do to promote corporate wellness in your organization?

As companies look toward providing healthier options for their employees, virtual corporate wellness programs are popping up left and right. With this sudden onset of options ranging from on demand apps to high intensity bootcamps, what’s best for your team?

While on demand apps allow flexibility of schedule, they still leave your employees feeling siloed and removed from their coworkers. At Swift Fit Events, we thrive on the interaction of our community. Our virtual offerings are Zoom rooms limited to 20 guests so that our professional instructors can provide the same experience you would get with an in-person workout. With 20 guests, your team will still feel connected to their coworkers while getting that personalized workout.

Catering to every fitness level and personality type in your company, Swift Fit Events offers a variety of sessions. Our elite instructors are able to accommodate any fitness level in any of our group sessions. Your high intensity folks (looking at you, sales team!) might love our bootcamp classes, and dance fitness might be more aligned to your marketing folks. A group meditation is a great way to focus your team before a sales blitz or a brainstorming session.

No matter what you’re looking to accomplish with your corporate wellness program, Swift Fit Events can help you customize the ideal solution to bring your team together, even during quarantine. We’re here to help you encourage a healthy mind-body connection while your team may feel uneasy or stressed.

Lastly, we want to match your vibe. Our speciality is blending into the culture and personality of our clients’ events and we’ll be able to adapt to meet the energy of your team, as well.

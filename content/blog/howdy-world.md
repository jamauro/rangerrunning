We’re so excited to be here! Let me tell you a little bit about how we got started. Ranger Running grew out of three friends’ love of lacing up the kicks and pounding the pavement. With diverse backgrounds in tech, the Army Rangers, and selling running shoes, we all bring something different to the table. We know how to use the latest technology to provide you with enhanced amenities, we have precise organization and discipline, and we have a wealth of knowledge and experience organizing and leading running events. But most of all, we are runners who love getting out there and having a blast. We are thrilled to be here to help get your event up and running.
